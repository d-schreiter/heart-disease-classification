# heart-disease-classification
In this small project I wrote a classification model for heart diseases. 
The dataset was pulled from kaggele: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction.
I compared three different classification approaches in terms of "Train-Accuracy", "Test-Accuracy" and "F1-Scores"
for Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests(without/including GridSearch Cross-Validation).

I achieved a 90% accuracy without heavy overfitting with the Random Forest model using GridSearch Cross-Validation.
